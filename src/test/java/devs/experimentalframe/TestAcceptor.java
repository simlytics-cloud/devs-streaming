/**
 * TestAcceptor is a class that extends the abstract {@code Acceptor} model and validates incoming
 * events based on their port identifiers and associated values. It represents a model in a DEVS
 * (Discrete Event System Specification) simulation that processes external inputs on specific ports
 * and executes validation checks for correctness.
 * <p>
 * The class expects two types of external inputs: - A numeric value on the "acceptNumber" port,
 * which is validated against a calculated expected value. - A string value on the "acceptWord"
 * port, which is validated against an expected word based on the current simulation time.
 * <p>
 * The {@code externalStateTransitionFunction} is implemented to perform the validation logic for
 * the incoming port values.
 * <p>
 * The validation logic for the "acceptNumber" port ensures: - The numeric value received matches a
 * logarithmic function of the current simulation time, except for time t = 1.
 * <p>
 * The validation logic for the "acceptWord" port ensures: - The string value received matches a
 * predefined expected word based on simulation time steps.
 * <p>
 * Any unexpected port identifier in the input throws an {@code IllegalArgumentException}.
 * <p>
 * This model does not produce any output events, as it inherits this behavior from the
 * {@code Acceptor} base class.
