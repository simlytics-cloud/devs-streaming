/**
 * KafkaSimTimeKey is a generic key class used for message identification based on simulation time
 * and an additional index within a Kafka-based simulation framework.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this class is to uniquely identify messages or data points exchanged during
 * simulation by representing a combination of simulation time and an index parameter. The
 * simulation time is represented by the {@link SimTime} class, while the index is a {@code Long}.
 * <p>
 * Generic Parameters: - T: Represents the type of simulation time. It must extend the
 * {@link SimTime} abstract class, ensuring compatibility with various time representations.
 * <p>
 * Key Features: - Encapsulation of a {@code SimTime} instance, which provides simulation timing
 * data. - An index parameter, used as an additional identifier, enabling distinction of messages
 * with the same simulation time. - Lightweight class with getter methods for accessing its
 * contents.
 * <p>
 * Constructor: - Instantiated via a public constructor with both the {@code simTime} and
 * {@code index} arguments. - Compatible with Jackson's JSON deserialization via annotations like
 * {@code @JsonCreator} and {@code @JsonProperty}.
 * <p>
 * Applicability: - This class is typically used as part of a Kafka-based simulation system,
 * contributing to simulation messaging and identification mechanisms.
