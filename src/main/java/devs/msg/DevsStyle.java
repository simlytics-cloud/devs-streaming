/**
 * Meta-annotation for configuring the style and naming conventions of immutable value classes
 * within the DEVS Streaming Framework.
 * <p>
 * This annotation leverages Immutables framework's {@link Value.Style} to define specific
 * conventions for class and builder generation: - Abstract types are prefixed with "Abstract". -
 * Generated immutable implementations match the abstract type names without the "Abstract" prefix.
 * - Staged builders are enabled for fine-grained control over instance creation.
 * <p>
 * This annotation can be applied at a package or type level to maintain consistency across related
 * classes. It simplifies the creation and management of immutable objects essential for the
 * framework's operation.
