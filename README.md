This project is a Java implementation of the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) as specified by Zeigler, Muzy, and Kofman in [Theory of Modeling and Simulation (TMS)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780128133705/theory-of-modeling-and-simulation).  In particular, it implements Parellel DEVS Models (TMS Section 4.3) executed by a Parallel DEVS Simulator (TMS Section 4.4) and a Root Coordinator (TMS Section8.1.3).

DEVS derives its hierarchical specification from formal systems specification and inherits its closure under coupling property (TMS Section 5.8).  This enables a natural correspondence between the hierarchical structure of real systems, system, sub-system, components, and models of systems, sub-systems, and components.
